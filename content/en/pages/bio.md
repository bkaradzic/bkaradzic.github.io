I received my first computer, the [ZX Spectrum 48K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum), sometime in 1984. The BASIC prompt that appeared upon booting immediately sparked my fascination with programming. In the first few years, I played games, typed code from books and magazines, and created small programs of my own. From 1994 to 1997, I was captivated by the [demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene), producing demos and sub-4K intros in x86 assembly on PC. Building on that experience, I transitioned to game development, which I've pursued ever since. In the meantime, I also grew interested in releasing my code as open-source projects for anyone who wishes to use it.
